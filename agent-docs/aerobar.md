## Overview

### Toasts

Floating, solid toasts for results people should notice — always shown here; in the phone above they rise in after Buy or Sell.

### Inline or floating

Inline, it's a full-width strip that sits in the layout (the market-hours warning above). Floating (isFloating), it's a rounded, shadowed toast inset 16px from the edges that rises in when shown.

Without `floating` it's a full-width strip that sits in the layout (the market-hours warning above). With `floating` it's a rounded, shadowed toast inset 16px from the edges that rises in when shown.

### Soft or solid

Figma's isPrimary: the light tint (False) suits information that can wait; the solid color (True) is for results people should notice straight away. Danger is read out to screen readers immediately; the others politely.

Figma's isPrimary: the default light tint suits information that can wait; the solid color (emphasis="primary") is for results people should notice straight away. Danger is announced immediately to screen readers (role="alert"); the rest politely (role="status"). For a danger bar that is part of the page rather than a new event, pass `role="status"` so it isn't read out as an alert on every visit.

## Do / Don't

### Let people act before it goes

- ✅ **Do:** Toasts with an action stay until tapped or closed.
- ❌ **Don't:** Hide important info or undo behind a timer.
