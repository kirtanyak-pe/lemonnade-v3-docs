## Import

```tsx
import { Select } from './components/Select' // path relative to src/
```

## Overview

### No box

Select is just the current choice and an icon. It sits in a row or a header; tapping it opens a bottom sheet with the options as radio rows. Use **↕** when it switches between a few modes (Quantity ↔ Amount, Total P&L ↔ Day P&L, the asset in a title). Use the **chevron** for a filter list (Deposit & Credits).

### Sizes

**Small** (Label-12) in form rows, **Medium** (Label-14) for filters, **Large** (Heading-14) for titles. **Subtle** makes it secondary grey when it shouldn't compete with the content. Make the whole row or header tappable, not only the text. Select hugs its content — no box, no padding — and its 48 × 48 touch area is invisible, so it never makes the row taller.

A `<button aria-haspopup="dialog">`; pass `expanded` while the sheet is open. Its touch area grows to 48 × 48 without taking layout space.

## Props

## Recent changes

- **1.0.2** (2026-10-10) 48 × 48 touch area: The touch area is at least 48 × 48 (was 32). Select still hugs its label and icon, so rows don't get taller.
- **1.0.1** (2026-10-09) Lemonnade switch arrow: The ↕ toggle is now the Lemonnade "Switch arrow toggle" icon from the Figma icons library (solid up and down arrowheads), instead of Material's unfold_more.
- **1.0.0** (2026-10-09) New component: Select: an inline label + icon that opens a sheet of options — Small, Medium, Large, a subtle version, and ↕ or chevron icons. New Figma component L3: Select (Size × isSubtle, ✏️ Label, ↪ Icon). A button with aria-haspopup="dialog" and aria-expanded; 32px tap area.
