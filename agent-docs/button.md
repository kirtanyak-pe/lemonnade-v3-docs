## Usage rules (USAGE.md)

`import { Button } from './components/Button'` · Figma: "L3: Button" (4471:29225) · Docs: `#/button`

A button starts an action. If it only navigates to another screen or section, it is still a Button when it
looks like one; text links inside content use a text action instead (see *Not a button*).

---

### 1. Choose the variant

| Variant | Use for | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| `primary` *(default)* | The main action of a screen, sheet or step: *Place order*, *Continue*, *Save*. | **One per screen** (one per sheet when a sheet is open). |
| `secondary` | The alternative action **next to a stronger button** (`primary`, `buy`, `sell` or `brand`): *Cancel*, *Modify*, *Edit order*. Its darker border only makes sense beside that stronger button. Mostly used in a **button dock / `ButtonGroup`, typically inside a bottom sheet**. | **Only alongside a stronger button.** Never on its own on the page or inside a card. |
| `tertiary` | Low-emphasis actions that sit **on the page or inside content**: *View all* at the end of a list, *Add another*, *Load more*, *Sort*. | Use this (not `secondary`) when the action stands alone. |
| `ghost` | Text-style actions with no container, inside other components: the Aerobar action, *Clear* next to search, inline *Edit*. **Hugs its content** (see 2). | Not as a screen's main action. |
| `brand` | Brand moments: onboarding, promotions, first-run CTAs. Follows the product color (Lemonn lime, CS PRO gold, Kuber green). | Not for everyday actions, not next to `buy`/`sell`. |
| `buy` / `sell` | **Only** to place or confirm a trade. Colors follow the product theme: `buy` uses the product's buy color (Lemonn lime, CS PRO market green, Kuber green), `sell` is red. | Never for unrelated actions (don't use `sell` as a "danger" button). |

**Rule of thumb: every action is `primary` (or `secondary`/`tertiary`/`ghost` around it), except buying or selling, which use `buy` / `sell`.** In Lemonn and Kuber `buy` and `brand` share the product color on purpose — they never appear on the same screen, so it isn't ambiguous.

Pairs that work: `secondary` + `primary`, `sell` + `buy`, `secondary` + `buy` (e.g. *Modify* + *Buy*), `secondary` + `brand`.
Pairs to avoid: two `primary`, `primary` + `buy`, `brand` + `primary`, a `secondary` on its own.

**Example — a list with a "View all" at the end:** the button is `tertiary`, not `secondary`, because it stands alone on the page.

### 2. Choose the size

| Size | Height (code; `ghost` hugs its content instead) | Use in |
|---|---|---|
| `lg` *(default)* | 48 (`size/control-lg`) | Bottom docks and `ButtonGroup` — **always `lg` there, never `md` or `sm`** (`ButtonGroup` warns in development). Also the main CTA of a screen or sheet. |
| `md` | 40 (`size/control-md`) | Actions inside content: cards, sheet bodies, form sections. |
| `sm` | 32 (`size/control-sm`) | Compact spots: empty-state action, inline row actions, toolbars, Actionbar actions (via `ActionbarAction`). |

- Buttons that sit side by side use the **same size**.
- **`ghost` hugs its content in every size** — no padding, no fixed height — so it's exactly as tall and wide as its
  label and icon. Don't give it a height or padding to make it easier to tap: its touch area does that.
- Every button has a **touch area of at least 48 × 48**. It's invisible and never adds space to the layout.
- **Figma:** the library's Ghost variants keep their fixed size (32 / 40 / 48), because existing designs rely on it —
  decided 2026-10-10. Set each new Ghost instance to **Hug** (width and height) where you place it; code always hugs.

### 3. Width & placement

- In a bottom dock with one action, use `fullWidth`. With two, use `ButtonGroup` (it sizes them for you). Dock buttons are always `lg`.
- `ButtonGroup` order: **horizontal → primary on the right**, **vertical → primary on top**. Keep the same order on every screen.
- Inside content, buttons hug their label (no `fullWidth`) and align to the start, unless they are the only element in a centred block (e.g. `EmptyState`).
- Don't put more than 2 buttons in a row on a 360px screen; move extra actions to a sheet or menu.

### 4. Label

- **Verb first, specific, sentence case:** *Place order*, *Add funds*, *Cancel order* — not *Submit*, *OK*, *Yes*.
- 1–3 words; no ending punctuation; no ALL CAPS.
- Labels must fit on one line at 360px in the chosen size. If it doesn't fit, shorten the label, don't shrink the text.
- Say the same action the same way everywhere (*Add to watchlist*, not *Save* on one screen and *Add* on another).

### 5. Label & icons: what can be shown

A button has three parts that can each be shown or hidden (Figma 👁️ Label · 👁️ Icon-L · 👁️ Icon-R):

| Label | Icon left | Icon right | Allowed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✓ | – | – | ✅ label only |
| ✓ | ✓ | – | ✅ |
| ✓ | – | ✓ | ✅ |
| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ label with an icon on both sides |
| – | ✓ | – | ✅ icon-only (needs `aria-label`) |
| – | – | ✓ | ✅ icon-only (needs `aria-label`) |
| – | ✓ | ✓ | ❌ **never two icons without a label** |
| – | – | – | ❌ **at least one part must be visible** |

The component enforces this: TypeScript rejects the two ❌ rows, and at runtime an icon-only button with two icons
shows only the left one (with a development warning).

### 6. Icons

- `iconLeft` reinforces the action (*+ Add*, *filter*); `iconRight` shows direction (*Continue →*).
- Use Material Symbols from `icons/material` (`<Icon icon={msAdd} />`); the button sizes the icon for you (24 / 20 / 16 by size — code).
- **Icon-only** buttons must have `aria-label`. In the top bar, use `ActionbarAction` instead of a bare Button.

### 7. States

- `loading` while the action is running (submitting an order, saving). It keeps the width and ignores taps, so it also prevents double submits (code). Don't change the label while loading.
- `disabled` only when the action isn't possible **and** the reason is visible nearby (e.g. an invalid field with its error message). Don't disable to hide a feature.
- After the action: show the result with an `Aerobar` (toast) or move to the next screen — don't leave the button as the only feedback.

### 8. Accessibility

- Buttons default to `type="button"` (code); use `type="submit"` for a form's main button.
- The label is the accessible name; with no label, `aria-label` is required.
- Don't put interactive elements inside a button.

### 9. Not a button

- **Tapping a whole card** → a clickable `Card`, not a Card with a single Button in it.
- **Inline text action** like *Filters* or *View details* in a toolbar → text in `content/accent/discover` (a real `<button>` or link underneath), not a Button.
- **Tabs / segmented choices** → `Tabs` (pill for chips).
- **Status labels** → `Tag` (tags are never tappable). Price moves use `profit` / `loss`, outcomes `success` / `error`.

### Code

```tsx
// Screen CTA in a dock
<ButtonGroup direction="horizontal" aria-label="Order actions">
  <Button variant="secondary">Modify</Button>
  <Button variant="buy">Buy</Button>
</ButtonGroup>

// Single full-width CTA
<Button fullWidth loading={saving} onClick={save}>Save changes</Button>

// Sheet dock: secondary only next to the stronger action, both Large
<ButtonGroup direction="horizontal" aria-label="Confirm">
  <Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
  <Button>Confirm</Button>
</ButtonGroup>

// "View all" at the end of a list: tertiary (it stands alone)
<Button size="md" variant="tertiary" iconRight={<Icon icon={msArrowForward} />}>View all</Button>

// Inside content
<Button size="md" variant="tertiary" iconLeft={<Icon icon={msAdd} />}>Add another</Button>

// Empty state action
<Button size="sm" iconLeft={<Icon icon={msDeleteForever} size={12} />} onClick={clear}>Clear</Button>

// Icon-only (outside the Actionbar): exactly one icon + aria-label; tertiary because it stands alone
<Button size="sm" variant="tertiary" aria-label="Share" iconLeft={<Icon icon={msShare} />} />
```

### Open questions

<!-- Decided 2026-10-10: destructive actions that aren't trades (Delete list, Remove card) are confirmed in a bottom sheet (BottomSheet/USAGE.md §7). -->
<!-- PENDING: which button style the destructive confirm uses — no danger variant exists -->
<!-- PENDING: is "Cancel order" a trade action (sell style) or a destructive action? -->
<!-- PENDING: difference in intent between tertiary and ghost beyond "container or not" -->
<!-- PENDING: brand vs primary — which screens count as "brand moments"? -->

## Overview

### Types

Seven types. Buy and Sell carry trade actions; Brand follows the product color (Lemonn lime, CS PRO gold, Kuber green).

PrimarySecondaryTertiaryGhostBrandBuySell

### Sizes

Large (48), Medium (40) and Small (32) — except Ghost, which hugs its label and icon in every size, with no padding and no fixed height. Every button has a touch area of at least 48 × 48 that doesn't take up any space in the layout.

LargeMediumSmall

### Secondary, tertiary and docks

Secondary (dark border) only appears next to a stronger button — primary, buy, sell or brand — usually in a sheet's button dock. On its own, on the page or inside a card, use tertiary instead (e.g. *View all* at the end of a list). Buttons in a dock or ButtonGroup are always Large.

### Label and icons

👁️ Label, ↪ Icon-L and ↪ Icon-R can each be hidden, but at least one must show. An icon-only button has exactly one icon — and the handoff needs the action's name (e.g. "Share") for screen readers.

Label, left icon and right icon can each be hidden, but at least one must show, and an icon-only button has exactly one icon (plus an `aria-label`). TypeScript rejects the other combinations.

### States

Loading keeps the button's width and ignores taps. Disabled uses the theme's disabled tokens.

## Do / Don't

### One primary action per screen

- ✅ **Do:** Pair one primary with secondary actions so the main step is obvious.
- ❌ **Don't:** Put several primary buttons side by side — nothing stands out.

### Secondary only beside a stronger button

- ✅ **Do:** Pair secondary with primary, buy, sell or brand — usually in a dock. Alone, use tertiary.
- ❌ **Don't:** Use a secondary button on its own on the page or inside a card.

### Use Buy and Sell only for trades

- ✅ **Do:** Use Primary for every action; Buy and Sell only for placing orders.
- ❌ **Don't:** Borrow their colors for unrelated actions like saving settings.

## Recent changes

- **1.7.0** (2026-10-10) Ghost hugs its content: Ghost hugs its content in every size — no padding, no fixed height — so it's exactly as big as its label and icon and never adds invisible space to a layout. Every button's touch area is at least 48 × 48 (was 32). It's invisible and doesn't change the layout.
- **1.6.0** (2026-10-10) Works in any React app: ref reaches the <button> (React 18 and 19): focus it, measure it. Development warnings no longer depend on Vite, so the button runs in Next.js, webpack and other bundlers. The loader artwork is built in (no .svg import).
- **1.5.0** (2026-10-05) New type weights: Text uses the three typography roles: titles Heading (750), labels Label (650).
