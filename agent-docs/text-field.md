# Input field & text box

> Fields let people enter text — a single line (input field) or several lines with a character counter (text box).

- Group: Input & control
- Lifecycle: done

## Import

```tsx
import { TextField } from './components/TextField' // path relative to src/
```

## Overview

### States come from the input

Figma draws six states. Default, Typing (dark border, blue caret) and Typed happen on their own as people type, and Disabled is for fields that can't be used yet. Design Error and Success yourself, with helper text that says what to do — try a quantity of 0 or a price outside the band above.

Figma draws six states. In code, Typing is focus (dark border, blue caret), Typed is simply having a value, and Disabled is the disabled attribute. Only Error and Success are set by you with `status` — try a quantity of 0 or a price outside the band above.

### Text box counter

A text box (isInputBox) with a character limit shows “n/max” under it. Typing past the limit is allowed but switches to the Error state with “Character limit reached”.

With `multiline` and `maxLength` the text box shows “n/max”. Typing past the limit is allowed but switches to the error state with “Character limit reached”, as in Figma.

## Do / Don't

### Always show a label

- ✅ **Do:** A visible label stays when people start typing.
- ❌ **Don't:** Rely on the placeholder as the label — it disappears on input.

### Explain errors

- ✅ **Do:** Say what went wrong and how to fix it.
- ❌ **Don't:** Show a red border with no message.

## Options (tree)

## Recent changes

- **1.6.0** (2026-10-10) Refs for forms: ref reaches the <input> (or <textarea> when multiline) on React 18 and 19 — react-hook-form's register works.
- **1.5.0** (2026-10-05) Typography role rules: Typography role rules: field label, typed text and the character counter use Label (a number never uses Description); helper text stays Description. Matches Figma.
