## Import

```tsx
import { Tabs, Tab } from './components/Tabs' // path relative to src/
```

## Overview

### Two components

**Tabs** (Figma "L3: Tabs group") is the bar: selection, horizontal scrolling on small screens, and arrow-key navigation. **Tab** (Figma "L3: base tab") is one item, in underline or pill form, md or sm.

### Three appearances

- **underline** (Figma Flat tabs) — sections of a screen; at the top they go in the Actionbar's bottom slot.
- **pill** (Figma Pill tabs) — a row of filter chips in one style: primary, secondary or tertiary. Never mix styles in a row. The first chip lines up with the 16 page margin: in Figma, Pill tabs bring their own 16 side inset for edge-to-edge rows — if the container already has 16 padding, set the tabs' inset to 0 so it isn't doubled.
- **pill-group** (Figma Pill group) — 2–4 options in a shared track to switch how the same content is shown (Tree / List). Its pills are always tertiary: the selected one is a black fill, the rest blend into the track.

### Same label, selected or not

Every tab label uses Label (650) — 14 for md, 12 for sm underline tabs, 12 / 10 for pills. Selection shows through the text color and the indicator bar (or the pill fill), never a bolder weight, so tabs never shift when the selection changes.

## Do / Don't

### Short, parallel labels

- ✅ **Do:** Two to four one-word sections of the same thing.
- ❌ **Don't:** Long labels that truncate, or tabs that act like buttons.

## Options (tree)

Tabs — Switch sections, filter or switch views

- **Appearance** — What it switches
  - `underline` — Sections of a screen. At the top: in the Actionbar bottom slot.
  - `pill` — A row of filter chips.
  - `pill-group` — 2–4 options in a track to switch views (Tree / List). Always tertiary.
- **Size**
  - `md` — Default.
  - `sm` — Dense filter rows inside content.
- **Width**
  - `hug` — Default. Tabs as wide as their labels.
  - `fill` — Tabs share the row; pill group pills become equal.
- **Pill options** — Chip tabs only
  - `emphasis: primary` — Default. Black fill when selected, light border when not.
  - `emphasis: secondary` — Dark outline when selected — inside cards and sheets.
  - `emphasis: tertiary` — Subtle fill, no border when unselected — quiet, dense rows.
  - `subLabel` — A second 8/10 line under the label.
  - `hideLabel` — Icon-only tab; the label stays as its name.

## Recent changes

- **1.7.1** (2026-10-10) 48 tall touch area: Pill tabs shorter than 48 get a 48-tall touch area (was 32) — vertical only, so pills side by side don't overlap.
- **1.7.0** (2026-10-05) New type weights: Text uses the three typography roles: titles Heading (750), labels Label (650).
- **1.6.0** (2026-10-04) Typography from Figma: Text styles follow the new Figma typography: labels use Label primary (label-primary-sb). Selected underline tabs keep the same SemiBold label as unselected ones (Figma no longer uses a bolder selected style).
