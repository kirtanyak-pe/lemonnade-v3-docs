## Do / Don't

### Checkboxes for many, radios for one

- ✅ **Do:** Radios when exactly one option can be chosen.
- ❌ **Don't:** Checkboxes for mutually exclusive options.

## Options (tree)

  - `unchecked`
  - `checked`
  - `indeterminate` — A parent with some children checked.

  - `ListCell as="label"` — Tap anywhere on the row to toggle.

## Recent changes

- **1.3.1** (2026-10-10) 48 × 48 touch area: The touch area around the box or dot is at least 48 × 48 (was 32), without changing its drawn size.
- **1.3.0** (2026-10-10) Refs for forms: Checkbox and Radio pass the ref you give them to the <input> — they used to replace it with their own, so form libraries like react-hook-form couldn't register them. The check and dash marks now draw on older Android phones too (Chrome / WebView before version 120).
- **1.2.0** (2026-09-26) Accessibility pass: Development warning when a checkbox or radio has no accessible name.
