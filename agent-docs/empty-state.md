## Import

```tsx
import { EmptyState, NoResultsIllustration } from './components/EmptyState' // path relative to src/
```

## Overview

### Say what happened, then offer a way out

Use the heading to say what's missing ("No results found") and the description to say what to try. Figma's CTA is a small primary Button, "Clear" with a delete icon, that resets the search. Tap it in the demo above, then type to see results come back.

### Illustration

The default is Figma's magnifier, and it follows the theme, including the brand color. You can swap in your own 120px artwork through the Illustration slot, or hide it.

The default is Figma's magnifier. It's an inline SVG and every fill is a token, so it follows the theme, including the brand color. Pass your own 120px artwork to `illustration`, or `null` to hide it.

### Layout and accessibility

The empty state fills the space it's in and centres itself; Figma's frame is a fixed 412px tall. If results change as someone types, the result count should be announced to screen readers — note it in the handoff.

The empty state fills its flex parent and centres itself; Figma's frame is a fixed 412px tall. The heading is an h2 by default (use `headingLevel={3}` under a section heading). The illustration is hidden from screen readers. If results change as someone types, announce the count separately, for example in a live region next to the search field.

## Do / Don't

### Offer a way forward

- ✅ **Do:** Say what happened and give an action to recover.
- ❌ **Don't:** Leave a blank screen or a dead end.

## Options (tree)

Empty state — Nothing to show, or no results

- **Parts**
  - `illustration + title + description + action` — Say what happened and give a way to recover.
  - `title only` — Small spaces; still never a dead end.
- **Heading level**
  - `h2` — Default: the empty state is the page content.
  - `h3` — Inside a section that already has an h2.

## Props
